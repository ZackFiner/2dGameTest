# 2D Helicopter Game
A 2 dimensional helicopter game made using openFrameworks.

## Features:
Collision Detection (Using Bounding Radius)  
Physics Simulation (For projectiles and Particle FX)  
Animated Sprite Sheets (For the helicopter blades)  
Sound Effects

## Description
This project was developed over the course of about 2 months. OpenFrameworks provided methods for image and audio loading and openGL. Everything else (Sprite Sheets, Entity Management, Physics, Particles, Collision Detection) was developed from scratch to suit the project's needs.
